# A cryptic crossword clue

## Problem Statement

> "Commercial in side or front of building."

The answer to the above cryptic will be a word in hexadecimal. Write a function
that returns the value to the above cryptic, converted to base 10. Your function
does not have to perform any calculation - it can just return an integer
literal. 

## My Solution

...
I just pasted the clue into a cryptic crossword solver and looked for an answer that could be written with the characters [A..F].
Other than a facade being a "front" for something, I still don't really understand why this is the correct answer.
