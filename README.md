# GSA ULTRA 2018
This repository contains my solutions for GSA ULTRA 2018. The questions all have their own folders, each with a README containing the problem statement and a description of how I went about solving it, and the code I wrote for it.

In the end I got 11 of the 13 answers correct in the crossword (though one of the incorrect ones was simply due to me not adding 10,000 to my answer as per the problem statement), so no prize for me.
